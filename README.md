# Easy Symbols Plugin for SuperMemoAssistant

## Features

- Easily insert symbols like Greek letters into SuperMemo HTML components using their human readable names.
- Easily customise the list of available symbols.

## Installation

1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/bjsi/SuperMemoAssistant.Plugins.HtmlTables/releases/latest) on this GitHub repository.
2. Download the latest available version.
3. Navigate to the development plugin folder (`C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\Documents\SuperMemoAssistant\Plugins\Development`) and extract the zip folder into the directory.

Note: If you are upgrading from an older version, you should delete the older version first.

## Usage

There is a single command:

1. Insert Symbol (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S)

If you have selected the name of a symbol, it will simply be replaced with the symbol. Otherwise, a placeholder that looks like this, `%_%`, will appear. Type the name of a symbol and it will automatically be converted into the symbol.

### Settings
